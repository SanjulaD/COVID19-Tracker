# COVID19-Tracker
ðŸ“ˆ Coronavirus (COVID-19) dashboard to show the dynamics of Ð¡oronavirus distribution.

Front-end wise I've tried to make it as simple as possible, therefore the dashboard is using a pure Javascript.

# Data source
The dashboard is using COVID-19 API [Health Promotion Bureau](https://www.hpb.health.gov.lk/en/api-documentation) (Sri Lanka) as a data source.
